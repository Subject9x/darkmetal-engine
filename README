POST-2014-MASTER BRANCH

### why: post 2014 changes are great...
however large changes were made to the build pipeline that have made
attempting to compile on Windows a nightmare that's not worth the cost. It's great these changes have been
made, but for my specific use-case, they fall outside the effort I can scope for what I need to do with the engine.

I may also cherry-pick commits from the branch to merge back into master - but MASTER IS 2014 STABLE!
always remember that.


### original readme stuff

To build DarkPlaces for iOS, you need to extract this zip into the source folder:
http://ghdigital.com/~havoc/SDLiOS20110208.zip

This is built from the in-development version of SDL 1.3, to make an updated include folder and libSDL*.a files, you need to get the SDL 1.3 source (from hg or a nightly build or whatever), then simply open Xcode-iPhoneOS/SDL/SDLiPhoneOS.xcodeproj and build libSDL for both simulator and device and then the SDL Application xcode template.

Then copy the include folder and two libSDL*.a files from the Xcode-iPhoneOS/SDL/build/Debug-template (or Release-template) into the darkplaces source folder, and it will build with your updated files.
