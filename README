To build DarkPlaces for iOS, you need to extract this zip into the source folder:
http://ghdigital.com/~havoc/SDLiOS20110208.zip

This is built from the in-development version of SDL 1.3, to make an updated include folder and libSDL*.a files, you need to get the SDL 1.3 source (from hg or a nightly build or whatever), then simply open Xcode-iPhoneOS/SDL/SDLiPhoneOS.xcodeproj and build libSDL for both simulator and device and then the SDL Application xcode template.

Then copy the include folder and two libSDL*.a files from the Xcode-iPhoneOS/SDL/build/Debug-template (or Release-template) into the darkplaces source folder, and it will build with your updated files.

## DarkMETAL engine

powers the `battleMETAL` TCM developed by myself.

### Planned Features (not many)
* change `id1` dir base name to `base`
* change exe icons to match battleMETAL.
* remove list of assets being loaded during level load.
* change loading screen logic to display specific images.
* stop players from automatically sliding down slopes.
* increase entity cap on the server.
* maybe clean up how client/serverinfo string access works.
* expose internal server cache list to QuakeC.
* and more as I go.
